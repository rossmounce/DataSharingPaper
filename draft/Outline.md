The main point of this paper is that we should share the data more, and in a more efficient way. We will explore four main questions: why we must (morally), why we should, how we can do it, and how the practice can be encouraged. We attached a draft of the introduction, and some of the last paragraphs summarizing our conclusion and message. The content of each sub-section is outlined.

# Intro

Claude Bernard [@Bernard1864] wrote that "art is *me*; science is *us*". This sentence has two meaning. First, the altruism of scientists is worth more than the self-indulgence of mid-nineteenth century Parisian art scene. Second, and we will keep this one in mind, creativity and insights come from individuals, but validation and rigor are reached through collective efforts, cross-validation, and peerage. Given enough time, the conclusions reached and validated by the efforts of many will take prominence over individualities, and this (as far as Bernard is concerned), is what science is about. With the technology available to a modern scientist, one should expect that the dissolution of *me* would be accelerated, and that several scientists should be able to cast a critical eye on data, and use this collective effort to draw robust conclusions.

In molecular evolution, there exists a large number of databases (GenBank, EMBL, SwissProt, and many more) in which information can be retrieved. This values (and allows) a new type of scientific research: building over the raw material of others, it is now possible to identify new phenomenon or evaluate the generality of previously studied ones. The job of these scientists is not to *make* data, neither to *stole* them, it's rather to gather them and, most of all, look at them in a different way. This would not be possible, if not for the existence of public, free, online repositories. It's impossible to be as enthusiastic when looking at current practices in ecology. Apart from a few, non-specific initiatives (*DataDryad*), or small-scale initiatives which are not always properly maintained (*Interaction Web Networks Database*), there is no data sharing culture among ecologists.

In this paper, using the example of ecological networks, we will argue that improving our data sharing practices will improve both the science, and the reputation of the scientists. We will illustrate how simple steps can be taken to greatly improve the situation, and how we can encourage the practice of data-sharing at different levels.

% Shall we have a table with good web examples of significant contributions to ecology that are impossible to achieve without data sharing? There are some questions that definitely need data sharing. 
% Another argument also would be that some data are so difficult to collect, it is so unproductive to leave them to some individuals. Think about the BCI data. It's such an impressive database, it stimulated a quantity of research that would not have been realistically accessible to a single team.
% I maintain my suggestion, it would make the paper funny to read if we collect a couple of typical sentences (and perhaps provide response) we get when we ask for data

# Why we morally must

- The data are publicly funded and do not belong to the researcher who collected them
- It allows reproducibility of the science, which is supposed to be the rule
- It will fight bad authorship practices, people hitch-hicking on other people's work
- Data are costly (time and money) to acquire, acquiring new instead of using old ones is wasteful

# Why is it beneficial for the one who collected data

- A proxy to your science: data are a mean for people to get familiar with what you do
- It stimulates collaboration and creativity
- A measure of your productivity: "dark data" effect, most of your work is not valorised

# How we technically can

- End the rule of Excel: JSON schemes or XML to represent context-rich data
- FigShare and other projects: data can have a DOI and be cited/shared
- Local databases but linked globally: APIs and programmatic access

# How it should be encouraged

- Journal policies, and referee expertise

Several journals are now asking the authors to deposit the data in a public repository. This is mandatory for sequences (GenBank), and various journals recommend the use of TreeBase, DataDryad, or FigShare. The referees are, however, rarely asked to evaluate if the adequate data are released (*e.g.* network metrics instead of full networks), and even more rarely given access to the data during the evaluation process.

- Evaluation for funding

# Conclusion

# List of possible boxes

- The story of the BCI data
- What we could tell about network biogeography with public data?
