  abstract = {There are many rules and procedures in the world of academia, and most of them date from a time when professors wore robes and rode horses, monks played the role of publishers, and graduate education was eerily similar to a page's apprenticeship to a knight. Some rules of academia have stood the test of time, such as the requirement that a scholar's work be read and tested by peers. But most have aged dramatically, and perhaps none so woefully as the notion of authorship.},
