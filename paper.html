<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Claude Bernard <span class="citation">(Bernard 1864)</span> wrote that “art is <em>me</em>; science is <em>us</em>”. This sentence has two meanings. First, the altruism of scientists is worth more to Bernard than the self-indulgence of mid-nineteenth century Parisian art scene. Second, and we will keep this one in mind, creativity and insights come from individuals, but validation and rigor are reached through collective efforts, cross- validation, and peerage. Given enough time, the conclusions reached and validated by the efforts of many will take prominence over individualities, and this (as far as Bernard is concerned), is what science is about. With the technology available to a modern scientist, one should expect that the dissolution of <em>me</em> would be accelerated, and that several scientists should be able to cast a critical eye on data, and use this collective effort to draw robust conclusions.</p>
<p>In molecular evolution, there exists a large number of databases (<em>GenBank</em>, <em>EMBL</em>, <em>SwissProt</em>, and many more) in which information can be retrieved. Such initatives value (and promote) a new type of scientific research: building-on and extending the raw material of others, it is now possible to identify new phenomenon or evaluate the generality of previously studied ones. The job of scientists relying on these databases is not to <em>make</em> data, neither to <em>stole</em> them, it is rather to gather them and, most of all, look at them in a different way. This would not be possible, if not for the existence of public, free, online repositories. It is sadly impossible to be as enthusiastic when looking at current practices in ecology. Apart from a few, non-specific initiatives (e.g. <em>DataDryad</em>), or small-scale initiatives which are not always properly maintained, there is no widespread data sharing culture among ecologists.</p>
<p>Yet in the recent years, there has been a strong signal that some organizations are ready to invest time and money in data sharing. For example, <em>DataONE</em> <span class="citation">(Reichman, Jones, and Schildhauer 2011)</span> is a large scale initiative, seeking to curate and make available observational data. We foresee that improving data sharing practices will be an important endeavor in the coming years, and the increasing awareness of the scientific community to these practices is a timely topic.</p>
<!-- Au final il n'y a pas tellement d'exemples dans le papier. On s'en reparle, mais ce serait pertinent je crois de ramener cette idée d'encadrés pour en détailler quelques uns. -->

<p>In this paper, using examples primarily taken from ecology and evolutionary biology, we will argue that improving our data sharing practices will improve both the quality of the science, and the reputation of the scientists. We illustrate how simple steps can be taken to greatly improve the situation, and how we can encourage the practice of data sharing at different levels <span class="citation">(Whitlock et al. 2010)</span>, and data citation, to encourage and reward sharing. Our most important point is that through sharing more data, we will increase both the quality and visibility of the science we produce. We conclude this paper by showing that most of the technical aspects of data sharing can easily be mastered, meaning that data are ready to be liberated!</p>
<h1 id="why-we-ethically-must">Why we ethically must</h1>
<p>An important point to make is that data sharing is a moral obligation of sorts. In this part, we point out the ethical aspects of data sharing, both with regards to other scientists, funding agencies, and your own collaborators.</p>
<h2 id="data-acquisition-is-mostly-publicly-funded">Data acquisition is (mostly) publicly funded</h2>
<p>In contrast with other fields such as energy, or pharmaceutical research, most ecological and evolutionary research is funded through public grants or charitably- funded programs. Or in other words, most research is dependent on taxpayers, indeed a recent HSBC report estimated that across the world 80% of research publications are funded by the public sector [@Graham2013]. In some fields, most notably conservation biology, it is not uncommon for volunteers to participate in data gathering. For example, the French temporal survey of common birds <span class="citation">(Jiguet and Julliard 2006)</span>, which resulted in 29 publications in peer-reviewed journals, is fed entirely through the work of amateur ornithologists. Given the direct (participatory) or indirect (financial) involvement of the public in ecological data collection, it is not surprising that some funding agencies have implemented data availability policies.</p>
<!-- % The worst thing is that there are such databases, collected by volunteers, are sold to researchers! -->

<p>For example, <em>BBSRC</em> (UK) state that “[p]ublicly-funded research data are a public good, produced in the public interest”, which “should be openly available to the maximum extent possible”. They further add that “[t]he value of data often depends on timeliness[;] it is expected that timely release would generally be no later than the release through publication of the main findings”. Similarly, <em>NERC</em> (UK) state that “[a]ll the environmental data held by the NERC Environmental Data Centres will normally be made openly available to any person or any organization who requests them.”. Sanctions for not sharing data are also put in place, as “[t]hose funded by NERC who do not meet these requirements risk having award payments withheld or becoming ineligible for future funding from NERC”. This perfectly mirrors one of the earliest drivers of the open access movement: science publications which are made possible through public investment must be made public. Publicly funded scientists, in most countries, are thus civil servants. Generating data is part of their job description, and there is no rational argument for which they should claim <em>property</em> of it. Claiming <em>paternity</em> of the data, as we discuss below, is a perfectly legitimate claim, but does not prevent sharing them.</p>
<!-- % Subtle but very important point at the end. Good job!
% It might be out of our reach, but it would have been nice to have a table with the most important countries in ecological/evolution research and which one whose funding agencies require open data.  -->

<h2 id="it-improves-reproducibility">It improves reproducibility</h2>
<p>Using journals to publish scientific information should not only serve the purpose of disseminating data analysis; it should maximize the ability of other researchers to replicate, and thus both validate and expand, results. It is arguably a perversion of the <em>publish-or-perish</em> mentality, that we think only in terms of papers. Interestingly, although editors and referees are very careful about the way the <em>Materials &amp; Methods</em> sections of a paper are worded, it is extremely rare to receive any comment by referees about the data availability.</p>
<!-- % Similar to the above comment, there are not so many journals asking for the data (is Am Nat the only one? do they ask for the full dataset?) -->

<p>This can cause problems at all steps of the life of a paper. How can a paper describing a new method be adequately reviewed if data are not available? How can you be sure that you are correctly applying a method if you can’t reproduce the results? Can increased pressure to release the full dataset will help identify the (admittedly rare) cases of data falsification? The movement of <em>reproducible research</em> <span class="citation">(Mesirov 2010)</span> advocates that a paper should be self-contained, <em>i.e.</em> be not only the text, but also the data, and the computer code to reproduce the figures. Even without going to such lengths, releasing data and computer code alongside a paper should be viewed as an ethical decision. Barnes <span class="citation">(Barnes 2010)</span> made the point that even though researchers are not professional programmers, computer code is good enough to be shared.</p>
<h2 id="it-will-clarify-authorship">It will clarify authorship</h2>
<p>It’s well accepted that the final of a scientific article reflects the diversity of backgrounds and scientific sensibilities of its authors <span class="citation">(McGee 2011)</span>. Yet authorship, in the sense of deciding who gets to be listed as an author, and in which order, is still a key issue in several collaborations. Additionally, authorship deserves to be properly quantified <span class="citation">(Tscharntke et al. 2007)</span>, to reflect the amount of work done by each contributor. Too strict rules of authorship will not award proper recognition, and rules too open will grant undue credit. To some extent, journals attempted to qualify the work of each contributor by having special sections, indicating who wrote the paper, conceived the study, or contributed data or reagents. This is far from being anecdotal, as it allows for increased accountability <span class="citation">(Weltzin et al. 2006)</span>. By making dataset public and citable, the contribution of data will become less and less of a criteria for authorship. Because the datasets can be cited independently from their original paper, they will also contribute to the overall scientific impact of the researcher who generated them, thus allowing to name as authors only those who analysed the data.</p>
<h2 id="data-cost-money">Data cost money</h2>
<p>Gathering data, either in the lab or in the field, costs money, as it requires the acquisition and maintenance of equipments and reagents, in addition to salaries. In this perspective, generating new data when existing ones are available and could bring answers to a question is a wasteful practice. So as to avoid this, we need to have an easy way to find suitable data, which require thorough indexing. The large amount of hard to access data was dubbed ‘dark data’ <span class="citation">(Heidorn 2008)</span>. The fraction of data falling within this category is likely to increase. <span class="citation">(Wicherts et al. 2006)</span> surveyed the field of psychology, and showed that asking for the raw data often does not result in a successful data sharing outcome, even after 6 months of repeated inquiries. Authors can claim to have ‘lost’ the data, can be extremely slow to reply, can ignore emails, the given contact email address may be invalid and difficult to find the ‘current’ contact address. Authors also die, and sadly this can result in the loss of valuable scientific data unless it has been accessibly and discoverably archived elsewhere. Ultimately, authors can also flat out refuse to give the data. The practice of releasing data into the public domain with a CC0 waiver (best) or with minimally-restrictive licences (some of which are explained in a later section), and associated with standards-compliant metadata, will help fight this effect. Overall, by making data easier to access, understand, and re-use, we will decrease the flow of funding going into data gathering, and thus decrease the financial pressure on labs.</p>
<p>Assuming that the increase of data sharing will result in more recognition of the work involved in data collection and curation (which we detail later), data sharing can also be a way of valorizing “negative” results. Because the likelihood of a paper being published depends on the significance of the results it reports, the publication bias in favour of positive results is well documented across all scientific fields, and results in the accumulation of statistical bias over time <span class="citation">(Scargle 2000)</span>. By dissociating the data from the paper, and recognizing data as a form of scientific production, it is possible to encourage the publication of “negative” results. This will allow (i) to produce research output even though the analysis is not conclusive (thus providing at least some return on investment), and (ii) to improve the planning of future experiments, because pre-existing data reporting both positive and negative outcomes will be available, thus allowing to make more informed decisions.</p>
<h1 id="which-benefits-it-will-bring-us">Which benefits it will bring us</h1>
<h2 id="a-proxy-to-your-science">A proxy to your science</h2>
<p>Datasets are an alternative means by which people can discover the research that you do. There is evidence showing that data availability improves reproducibility and adequate communication of results <span class="citation">(Ince, Hatton, and Graham-Cumming 2012)</span>. Similarly, in some fields, releasing computer code under open source licenses <span class="citation">(Vandewalle 2012)</span> or sharing research data <span class="citation">(Piwowar, Day, and Fridsma 2007)</span> is associated with increased citation rates for your papers. Yet one of the argument often opposed by people reluctant to share their data is that they might risk loosing paternity of them. The previously cited analyses show that by <em>not</em> sharing data, we are exposed to a higher risk of our research being ignored, simply because other people cannot re-use or re-examine the data. By developping a culture of data sharing, and adequate citation of the datasets re-used, the origin of the data (and thus their paternity) will be made clear. It seems that by reserving intellectual <em>property</em> rights over data, there are real risks of data not getting the usage it deserves, reducing scientists potential impact.</p>
<h2 id="it-stimulates-collaboration-and-creativity">It stimulates collaboration and creativity</h2>
<h2 id="it-is-a-significant-measure-of-your-research-impact">It is a significant measure of your research impact</h2>
<p>The NSF (US) Grant Proposal Guidelines for 2013 have notably stopped referring to ‘Publications’ and instead refer to ‘Products’ [@Piwowar2013]. This change was made specifically to make it clear to scientists that research funders now see great value in in research products, not <em>just</em> publications. Research products “include, but are not limited to, publications, data sets, software, and patents”. Thus published, shared datasets are now ‘first class research objects’ as they should be (http://www.force11.org/white_paper). We think this is a healthy move that will soon be copied by many research funders across the world. Modern science needs more than just publications, it needs shared data to function efficiently. By formally recognising and encouraging applicants to put shared datasets on their CV’s and show the re-use of these datasets, the NSF is recognising the immense and largely untapped value of data re-use. Just like publications, some datasets will be more re-used &amp; cited than others. Thus research evaluation excercises will soon be looking to measure the impact of one’s data and software, not just publications.</p>
<h1 id="how-we-technically-can">How we technically can</h1>
<p>In addition to the ethical and pragmatic arguments made above, we engage here in a more technical reflexion about how we should include data sharing early in the studies, so as to generate data in a format allowing their re-usability. We also briefly discuss the different licensing options.</p>
<h2 id="data-representation">Data representation</h2>
<p>Except when they are deposited into large-scale databases, data usually live (in various states of dormancy) on the hard drives of researchers. These data are usually formatted in the way where they were used to produce the few figures or run statistical analyses used in the published account, which is to say mostly as a spreadsheet, or a raw text file <span class="citation">(Akmon et al. 2011)</span>. Yet, more robust and sharing-friendly formats exists, which should be taken advantage of.</p>
<!-- % The following sentences are a bit nerdy and not accessible -->

<p>For example, the <em>JavaScript Object Notation</em> <span class="citation">(Crockford 2006)</span> allows a context-rich representation of data, which can be based on templates. Building upon this format, a working group can put together a syntax to represent a given type of ecological data, then provide JSON templates for other people to release these data. In the ecological sciences, there are now publications outlets focused only on methodological papers (<em>Methods in Ecology and Evolution</em>, and to some extent <em>BMC Bioinformatics</em>), and several other journals have sections for methodological papers. JSON parsers exists for almost all languages (notably C, Python, R, Java), which means that different applications will be able to access the shared information. Under this perspective, it is possible to build local databases. As long as they respect the specification, groups only need to share the access to these databases, to enable all scientists to access the data. A “global” access can still be achieved by wrapping all of the local data sources, though an API, as detailed in the following section.</p>
<h2 id="database-linkage">Database linkage</h2>
<p>An important obstacle is that maintaining a global database requires funding on a scale which is orders of magnitude higher (in terms of amount and duration) than what most grants will cover.</p>
<!-- % The following paragraph is also a bit abstract for someone (like me) not familiar with APIs -->

<p>The solution, building on an increased use of strict data specification, is to link several local databases through APIs. In short, an API is an application stored on a server, which will offer several <em>methods</em>, each returning a <em>reply</em>. For example, a <em>method</em> can be “retrieve all datasets containing species A”, and the <em>reply</em> will be a list of datasets identifiers. If a particular data format is applied to more than one database, it becomes possible to query them at once. Under this perspective, the origin of the data do not matter, because the API will return them in a standardized fashion. Each group implementing such a database can, in this situation, share the informations related to data access. Instead of putting the raw data on a data sharing platform (some of which are reviewed below), the authors will give informations about the study, and informations about where the data are stored, and how to access them.</p>
<h2 id="legal-issues---waivers-licenses-and-copyright-law">Legal issues - waivers, licenses and copyright law</h2>
<p>Perhaps the point with which scientists will have less familiarity with is the licensing or waivers under which data should be made available. Broadly speaking, a licence is a text legally defining how content can be used, modified, and distributed. Fortunately, easy to understand, non-restrictive licenses exist, which are fit for scientific outputs. The most well known family of them is the <em>Creative Commons</em> (CC) set. This family of licenses arose from a need to relax the default restrictions of normal ‘All Rights Reserved’ copyright status, to expressly allow redistribution and re-use of content on the internet within the framework of existing copyright law <span class="citation">(Lessig 2004)</span>. <span class="citation">(Hrynaszkiewicz and Cockerill 2012)</span> remind us that copyright does not apply to factual data, and so licenses should not be applied to this data.<br />Where possible it is best to apply the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) Waiver to scientific data in most cases, to ensure that re-use is as frictionless and<br />legally-unencumbered as possible. The CC0 waiver does not legally force citation of data when it is re-used. Nor should it. No-one to our knowledge has ever sued another party for lack of academic acknowledgement of data re-use. These matters are not policed by legal courts, but rather the social and community norms of academics and thus have no need for legal protection by copyright law. Legally enforcing even just attribution via a licensing mechanism can and does cause <em>real problems</em> that are best avoided e.g. ‘attribution stacking’ [@Mietchen2012], thus CC0 is recommended for most data to avoid unnecessary complications.<br />This particular waiver is used by <em>Dryad</em> (a data repository associated with, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>The American Naturalist</em>) and <em>fig<strong>share</strong></em> (though only for datasets). Where the<br />‘data’ is more artistically-expressed this can, if desired, be licensed e.g. a photograph, micrograph or video. An<br />acceptable licence that minimally impedes the progress of science is the Creative Commons Attribution (<em>CC BY</em>) license, which allows use and reproduction of the data as long as the original data is cited in the manner specified by the author(s) and not in any way that suggests that they endorse the re-use (this licence is<br />used for all non-data submissions in <em>fig<strong>share</strong></em>). Concerns over the use of CC BY in academia have been exhaustively answered by Creative Commons recently as so many academics in the UK were confused [@CreativeCommons2013]. The <em>Creative Commons</em> website offers an intuitive free tool to choose a license<br />(<code>http://creativecommons.org/choose/</code>). We urge readers to take heed of the above, and strongly encourage scientists to be aware of the pitfalls associated with the other more restrictive license modules available when selecting a waiver or license.<br />[<span class="citation">Hagedorn et al. (2011)</span> ; @Klimpel2012].</p>
<h1 id="how-it-should-be-encouraged">How it should be encouraged</h1>
<h2 id="the-role-of-journals">The role of journals</h2>
<p>Journals are in the best position to make things move <span class="citation">(Vision 2010)</span>, because a scientist career depend on getting its papers accepted. Although when possible, a bottom-up approach should always be preferred, editors have in their hand a formidable lever to modify our collective behavior. Some journals are now asking the authors to deposit their ecological data in a public repository <span class="citation">(Fairbairn 2011 ; Whitlock et al. 2010)</span>.</p>
<!-- % As mentionned earlier, it might be nice to list them in a table if possible -->

<p>This is mandatory for sequences in all journals (<em>GenBank</em>), and similar mandatory archiving of all data in TreeBase, DataDryad, or FigShare is becoming a common practice. The referees are, however, rarely asked to evaluate if the adequate data are released, and even more rarely given access to the data during the evaluation process. About this last point, an increased collaboration between journals and data sharing platforms, to allow referees to anonymously access the data, should be encouraged. In practice, authors are still free to release summary statistics instead of raw data, which allows to reproduce the paper, but not to confirm the validity of the approach.</p>
<p>Journal-led mandates cannot be the only solution used. When compliance with journal stipulations are retrospectively checked, even clinical trials data compliance <span class="citation">(Prayle, Hurley, and Smyth 2012)</span> and <em>GenBank</em> archiving of data are not universally adhered to, even in the ‘best’ journals of highest reputation <span class="citation">(Noor, Zimmerman, and Teeter 2006)</span>. Journals must take care that data archiving mandates are enforced and not just ‘rhetoric’, be it through increased editorial control, or by asking the referees to evaluate the data sharing plans. In addition, journals should implement incentives for authors to cite the datasets, and not just the paper to which they are attached. Strong limitations on the number of references can currently impede this practice, as it will force authors to choose citations. In the context of meta-analyses, this can become especially problematic. The solution of having references part of the supplementary materials is not optimal either, as it comes with no assurance that they will be registered as a citation to the dataset, and will benefit from less exposure. To this effect, having an additional reference, as it will valorize the production of data as literature items.</p>
<h2 id="the-role-of-funding-agencies">The role of funding agencies</h2>
<ul>
<li>recognition of the value of data contributions</li>
<li>one short term solution is to create data journals and consider them as papers. It does not give much credit to the contribution: one paper = one dataset. Some public data had much more important structuring roles than the original papers publishing them for the first time (e.g. BCI data)</li>
<li>Evaluation of projects and CVs: particuliar value to datasets, standing on its own just as papers and patents</li>
<li>a discussion going beyong our role as scientists: should the agencies require publication of data? Needs a more general reflexion</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>In the last two years, there were an important number of media outbursts, and public indignation, about the role of science and scientific conduct. They may all have been avoided if the practice of putting data publicly online was widespread. The so-called <em>climategate</em> <span class="citation">(Jasanoff 2010)</span> could have been largely averted if all data were made public in the earlier days of the affair, as it was later clearly demonstrated that the apparent lack of transparency eroded public trust in scientists <span class="citation">(Leiserowitz et al. 2010 ; Ravetz 2011)</span>. Even more recently, the controversy over a study on the carcinogenicity of GM maize <span class="citation">(Séralini et al. 2012)</span> was thickened by the refusal of both sides (Monsanto and the French research group) to release the full data, in addition to many undisclosed conflicts of interests <span class="citation">(Meldolesi 2012)</span>.</p>
<p>When journal editors started publicly discussing the matter, they called this <em>data archiving</em> <span class="citation">(Fairbairn 2011 ; Whitlock et al. 2010)</span>. We would exhort other scientists not to use this expression. Data <em>archiving</em> evocate cardboard boxes, in which data are put to collect some dust. Whether this happens in the hard-drive of a scientist or in a well-maintained repository only differs in the fact that the later solution comes with a DOI. We think that the process or making data available should be called in a way which reflects its objectives: <em>data sharing</em>. We have the technology in place to give data a second life, in which the scientific community can appropriate them, recognize the paternity of those who generated them, and acknowledge this through citations. Data are all we care about. They make our papers possible. They bring answers to our questions, and much better, questions to our answers. After serving us so well, they deserve better than to be <em>archived</em>.</p>
