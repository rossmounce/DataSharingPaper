# Replies to referee comments

We have completed the revision of our submission *4632*. We note that both
authors answered *Yes* to the question about the ability of our article to
have an impact on the subject of area. Other than that, the two referees
raised several valid issues, which we thoroughly adressed. We would like to
thamk them for helping strengthening our point.

## Reviewer 1 (Jones)

As ref. 1 points out, most of our paper discusses recent advances in our
behavior regarding data sharing. This is done *on purpose*. On one hand,
previous forum papers on the subjects have already been reviewed
and synthesized, and as such there is no interest in reproducing
the exercise. On the other hand, it's hard to argue against the
fact that the playing field of data-sharing has changed *a lot* in
the recent years. The last two years alone saw the apparition of
*figshare*, changes in policy of several journals and societies
(notably the BES) regarding open data, and more broadly, the rise of
an ecosystem of open-source projects leveraging these open datasets.

These aspects now need to be addressed, and this is the objective of our
paper: to ensure that the discussion around open-data accounts for these
practical and technological developments. **We reinforced this aspect on the
revision of our paper**.

Ref. 1 argues against JSON as a robust format for data interchange. This is
a baffling position, for several reasons. JSON, over several other formats
proposed by the referee, can be validated against schemes. This ensures that
the data are syntactically correct. In addition, the scheme describes the
data format and typing, and as such serves as its own data-specification.
Although a JSON object is, as the ref. says, not self-descriptive, the
combination of JSON and a scheme, with the possibility of automatic
validation, is. Regardless of the quality check allowed by JSON + schemes,
this format emerged as a *de facto* standard for API, which already are
the favorite way to interact with large, open datasets. **We reinforced
the case for JSON in the paper**.

The referee point abou *archiving* vs. *sharing* reflects its own opinion. As
this is an opinion paper, we take the risk of irritating some readers by our
vocabulary choice. **We kept the incriminated part, but re-inforced our
point**.
